How To Automate Strategizing Podcast Content with SerpApi and Python

For more information, please read the related blog post: https://serpapi.com/blog/automate-strategizing-podcast-content-with-serpapi-and-python/

## Getting Started With Using SerpApi

You can use our APIs in multiple languages, but for the purposes of this blog post, I'm going to be using Python.

To begin scraping data, first, create a free account on serpapi.com. You'll receive one hundred free search credits each month to explore the API.

Get your SerpApi API Key from this page: https://serpapi.com/manage-api-key.
[Optional but Recommended] 

Set your API key in an environment variable, instead of directly pasting it in the code. Refer here to understand more about using environment variables. For this tutorial, I have saved the API key in an environment variable named "SERPAPI_API_KEY" in my .env file.

Next, on your local computer, you need to install the `google-search-results` Python library: `pip install google-search-results`

## How To Run This Code

Run file main.py using `python main.py`
